Over fifteen years of experience in the IT industry with a background in different organizations and roles like as a software engineer, project manager and enterprise architect.

My focus is on designing software development and IT processes, applying agile methods, analyzing IT landscapes, planning software and integration architectures, for example for individual software or ERP solutions. 

I have two degrees from the Vienna University of Technology and as co-founder and chairman of the [CoderDojo Wien](https://wien.coderdojo.net) as well as [Youth Hackathon](https://youthhackathon.com/) Ambassador I am also dedicated to the promotion of young IT talents.
