Currently I'm taking part in the preview of the [_Azure Compute Gallery - community galleries_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/share-gallery-community). As I've been a fan of the ArchLinux distribution for some years already, I took this opportuinty to start maintaning an ArchLinux image share to Azure community.

If you're interested just check for it under it's name `arch-linux` by publisher `danielwagn3r` - which is me.
