CoderDojo is a club for kids and teens who want to learn programming and have fun.

For several years now, I have had the privilege of promoting interest in software development as a champion of the _CoderDojo Wien_.

With 2023 I started with my engagement for the _CoderDojo Tulln_ to build up a local group in Tulln.

Both initiatives are bundled in the association _digital.austria_, of which I am currently chairman.
