After some initial failes with QEMU and due the possiblity of a Windows box with Hyper-V on it I choose that approach to bootstrap my image. Initally I even skipped cloud-init on only packaged the waagent in the image, but I soon saw that the handling of an cloud-init enabled image was by far smoother when on Azure.\nOn the portal this then looks like this:\nThe images is provided as is without any guarantee or liability.\nUpcoming work Currently the image only support generation 1 VMs on Azure. Support for generation 2 VMs 6 would be nice, but requires some work with Secure Boot. Azure enables trusted launch 7 per default with generation two VMs.\nAnother interesting option would be to provide an ARM based image, as Azure VMs with Arm are GA since September this year 8\nIn case anybody want\u0026rsquo;s to help with the work on this, just drop me a note.\nReferences https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/share-gallery-community\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/imaging\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://guyrobottv.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/running-arch-linux-on-microsoft-azure-in-2019/\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://codito.in/archlinux-on-azure/\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://gist.github.com/z3ntu/e2750efd7f0b93ab3427f097de3fbefa\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/generation-2\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/trusted-launch\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-virtual-machines-with-ampere-altra-arm-based-processors-generally-available/\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://danielwagner.at/posts/2022-11-26-archlinux-azure/","summary":"After years of using my favorite Linux distribution on my on-premise systems, like desktops, servers or even Raspberry Pis I\u0026rsquo;ve be always keen to use Arch on cloud as well.

There we used different data structures, to efficiently store the parsed programs. Often there were trees, but the key to day 10 is the Stack 1. Accompanying I use Dictionary 2 to efficiently lookup of matching brackets and gained scores.\nWith these data structures prepared, a test if a pair of brackets is matching results in simple lookups:\nbool Closes(char chunk, char match) { if (!dict.ContainsKey(chunk)) return false; return dict[chunk] == match; } Or the computation of the score:\nreturn errors.Select(e =\u0026gt; syntaxPoints[e]).Sum(); assuming errors is a list of the first illegal bracket of each line.\nPuzzle Two After solving the first puzzly, the second one is only a slight variation. In puzzle one you detected the corrupted lines, so the remaining ones are potentially incomplete.\nTo complete a line, you simply look at the remainder of the Stack used during analysis of the line.\nforeach (var c in chunks) { score *= 5; score += completionPoints[dict[c]]; } Full Source Full Source is available on GitHub. 3\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.stack-1\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.dictionary-2\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://github.com/danielwagn3r/AoC-2021/tree/main/Day10\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://danielwagner.at/posts/2021-12-10-aoc2021-day10/","summary":"Syntax Scoring solved using C#, advanced data structures and pattern matching.","title":"Advent of Code 2021 Day 10"},{"content":" The theme for today is:\nSometimes looking up is better than searching\nPuzzle One Think of clustering the lanternfish swarm into buckets of their current day of the creation cycle.\nUseGroupBy() 1 followed by ToDictionary() 2 to compute the initial clustering:\nIDictionary\u0026lt;int, long\u0026gt; swarm = input.GroupBy(d =\u0026gt; d).ToDictionary(i =\u0026gt; i.Key, i =\u0026gt; (long)i.Count()); Then you can computer the new clustering after an iteration by iterating over the buckets of your clustering and computing the new count of lanternfish and the new bucket(s).\nPuzzle Two Puzzle two is only about performance.
